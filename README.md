# Gendered Innovations

This map, built with [D3.js](http://d3js.org), aims to visualize collaborators for the [Gendered Innovations](http://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/) group at Stanford University. 

The visualizations are being directed by Londa Schiebinger, the John L. Hinds Professor of History of Science Director, and are built by [Jason A. Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org), Academic Technology Specialist for the [Department of History](http://history.stanford.edu). 

The visualization contains two maps:

1. The international aspects of the project. The map shows the gender of a collaborator (female or male) mapped to the participant's home location. The Gendered Innovations project is international, consisting of a network of sixty-nine contributors across thirty-eight countries. 
2. The interdisciplinary aspect of the project showing seven nodes where workshops and conferences were held. Additionally, these nodes include additional nodes showing which disciplines were involved. The Gendered Innovations project is interdisciplinary, and the map will show disciplines represented at workshops and in working groups.
